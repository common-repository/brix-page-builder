**Works on every theme**

Brix can be used with any WordPress theme and the best thing about its approach is that it doesn't lock you in. Brix doesn't rely on shortcodes: you can switch themes as many times as you like and your content will follow you, even if you disable the plugin completely.

**Works on every post type**

Brix can be activated on any post type. By default, it works for pages, but easy controls can make it work in other contexts as well, such as posts, portfolio items or even products.

**No coding required, yet developer friendly**

Brix allows you to visually compose any page or layout you can imagine with a grid-based, easy interface, without touching a single line of code.

Brix is friendly to developers too: the code is clean, efficient and well documented.

**FAST!**

Page builders can be slow, and nobody likes heavy plugins that slow down your website. Brix is different. Content generated by Brix is constantly optimized to only load the thing that you need, the moment you need them; Brix works great with caching systems, but even without any of them, the simple fact that it doesn't rely on shortcodes, makes it quick to render.

**Advanced Grid System**

With Brix interface, you can precisely control even the tiniest detail of your design in a professional way thanks to the most advanced grid management system ever created.

* **Padding and margin controls**. You can control spacing for every element on every device by using `px`, `em`, `%` or the unit you need.
* **Special column structures**. Combine full width section layouts or take advantage of the unique special section feature, and quickly adjust a row’s column structure with just a couple of clicks.
* **Quickly split & merge columns**. Adjust the row columns layout with just one click thanks to the innovative live split/merge controls.

**SEO ready**

You have full control over the markup that is generated by Brix. It’s up to you to choose the heading structure, and whether to use `section` tags or not; also, Brix works great with major WordPress SEO plugins like YOAST.

**Built to grow**

Brix has been designed to be modular and scalable and it can be extended with additional functionality and components with no hassle.

Also, we’re profoundly committed to make Brix better and better, and we’ll keep updating it regularly, extending its documentation and adding new tutorials as well.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Will it work on my theme too?**

YES! Whether your theme is free or premium, Brix will integrate with it seamlessly. Since the plugin hooks on `the_content`, the use of such function is pretty much the only requirement there is for Brix to work.

**Can I switch themes? Will I lose content in the process?**

Your content will NOT be lost when switching themes, regardless of the one you choose to use. Also, since the plugin doesn't rely on shortcodes, even deactivating the Brix plugin completely will leave you with perfectly readable content in your pages.

The only thing that's not kept, are the few global options that Brix has, which can be very specific to the theme you're using.

**How does support work?**

Support on the plugin page on WordPress.org is completely voluntary and as such it is very limited. Feel free to post bug reports, or questions about the plugin functionality.

For more dedicated support, please consider purchasing a copy of <a href="https://justevolve.it/product/brix/">Brix premium</a>, which comes with premium support from the Brix staff, as well as with lots of interesting and advanced features.

**How can I activate the premium version of the plugin, on top of the Lite version?**

If you had activated the Lite version of the plugin, you'll need to disable it in order to unlock premium functionality.
